# Real Estate Market Insights

## Description
This project aims to analyze the French real estate market using advanced data analysis and AI techniques. It combines geolocated real estate transaction data with macroeconomic indicators to build predictive models. The integration of generative AI enhances model performance by enriching the dataset with synthetic data.

## Project Objectives
- Collect and analyze open-source real estate transaction data in France.
- Incorporate macroeconomic indicators to capture market trends.
- Build predictive models to estimate real estate prices and demand.
- Improve predictions using generative AI (LLM fine-tuning, synthetic data).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MassiliaHe/Real-Estate-Prediction-with-Generative-AI.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd real-estate-market-insights
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Real-Estate-Prediction-with-Generative-AI
   ```

## Project Structure
- `Real-Estate-Prediction-with-Generative-AI`: The main notebook containing code and analysis.
- `data/`: Directory for storing data files.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Usage
1. Download the geolocated DVF data from [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/demandes-de-valeurs-foncieres-geolocalisees/).
2. Place the downloaded files in the `data/` directory.
3. Run the notebook cells to analyze the data, train models, and visualize results.
